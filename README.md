# BaggingClassifier

This notebook includes implementation of Bagging with Decision trees, SVM with different methods of random sampling

1] With replacement<br>
2] Without replacement<br>
3] Random Subspaces<br>
4] Random patches<br>

Random patches and subspaces should be used while dealing with high dimensional data<br>
To find the correct hyperparameter values we can do GridSearchCV.
